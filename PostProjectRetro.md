#### Post-Project Retro

**What aspects of your approach and attitude during this project would you like to improve upon?**

- Before diving into group work or pair programming, I usually work better independently at the beginning.
- I felt like I had a pretty good attitude throughout the project, although the worst feeling was breaking things (I would get really depressed about that)
- I also believed in my ability to find the solution, and that glimmer of hope, no matter in what situation

**What aspects of your coding process during this project would you like to improve upon?**
- I NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHY CARDS DISAPPEAR AFTER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF ROUNDS. 
- Passing through so many parameters in a function
- Generating deck of cards

**What lines of code are you most proud of and why?**
- Checking player's hand for Ace (line 120)
- Checking dealer's hand for Ace (line 161)
- Using stopPropagation (line 363) and preventDefault (line 400)

**What lines of code do you understand the least and why?**
None
