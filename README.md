#### Mid-Project Retro ####

* What are the features of your MVP? 

Features include the following: user is able to wager a bet, cards are dealt to player and dealer, the sum of cards can be calculated, an 'ace' can change its value to '1' or '11' depending on the outcome of the sum.

* What aspects of your approach and attitude so far have been the hardest? 

I've been eschewing the road that I typically take: worrying about the design and interface of the game. Rather, I have been actively focused on the logic and flow of the game. I have been planning the game through group collaboration, Trello, and pseudo-coding. I crank out one function at a time and make sure it's completely viable before endeavorng further. I am moving slowly and as things break (as they tend to do), I work to resolve them.

* What have you gotten done so far?

From scripts.js: 
line 85: `makeBet()`,
line 93: `startGame()`,
line 101: `checkPlayerAce()`, 
line 115: `dealToPlayer()`,
line 131: `checkDealerAce()`,
line 144: `dealToDealer()`

* What steps are you going to take to make sure that your goals are accomplished by project presentation time?
